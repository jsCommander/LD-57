**The Mind.**  
A chubby but determined psychiatrist begins a routine hypnosis session, and suddenly finds himself trapped inside his patient's nightmare-ridden subconscious.

Armed with his Lantern of Truth, he must journey deep into her psyche to confront three inner demons:

**Phlegma** - the embodiment of apathy  
**Fear** – a shadow from the past  
**Anger** – pure, destructive rage

Each level is a metaphor. Every monster reflects a hidden pain.

Your task is to help the patient take back control of her mind
